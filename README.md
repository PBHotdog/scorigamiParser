# Scorigami Calculator

Note: This is only "Pure" Scorigami, the dataset I was given only gives me the most recent games. So I can only do the counts of 1.

Also this was done very quick, so I didn't bother converting the old names over. Sorry :(

Columns in csv: ['Rk','Score','PtsW','PtsL','PtTot','PD','Count','','Last Game', 'Date']
